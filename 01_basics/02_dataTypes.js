"use strict"; // this line treats all JS code even if its of the older version as newer version

// a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security read it in the ecmascript specification.

// alert(3+3) // we are using nodeJS, not browser

// Code readability should be high priority // code readable bhi hona chahiye and future proof bhi. // confusing code nhi likhne ka write clean simple and readable code.

/* So DataTypes in JS
Mainly 2 groups : Primitives and Non Primitives 
                    7               probably just 1 which is object

            1:Number => ±(2^53−1)
            2:BigInt
            3:String => ""
            4:Boolean
            5:null => aik datatype hone ke saath saath it can be used as a standalone value too
            6:undefined
            7:symbol => unique

            typeof is an operator in js which tells the datatype of its operand
 
            typeof null gives an object its a known quirk in js
